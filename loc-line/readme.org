- ALL PARTS ARE TO BE MADE OF PETG/ABS - PLA is too brittle and does not work
- RANDOMIZE THE Z-SEAM ORIENTATION in the slicer - so the seam gets distributed evenly
- print the segments oriented with the rim on the bottom
- if the tube segments fit too lose or too tight adjust the flow/extrusion rate in 3% steps. it needs to be super tight
- print the segments in batches of 3 until you got the flow adjusted correctly
