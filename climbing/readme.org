** installation
These fit tightly on the carabiner and are semi-permanent. It is best to put them on a set of extra carabiners, and then swap them with the rope-side quickdraw carabiner prior to a rope solo outing

Installation Steps:

1. Soak the TPU Soft-Cinch in hot water for 3 minutes to soften the material, and lubricate the carabiner slot. Lubricate the body of the carabiner itself with clean water as well. (the Soft Cinch will be impossible to install without lubrication assistance!)
2. Start the Soft-Cinch onto the carabiner nose, starting with the hammer-head feature upwards and outwards.

The unique pass-through slot allows the Flex-Link to effortlessly fold into a racking mode. This lets the Flex-Link be hung loosely and out of the way on a carabiner.

* Quick release/fire :ATTACH:
Quick release is a 3d-printed friction based reusable release mechanism.

[[https://avantclimbing.com/products/quick-fire-cam-release][avant has a model]] for mounting on a harness to use with protection gear.

Some are also using a modified model for holding a GriGri in a inverted upright position(Held UpRight/HUR, [[https://youtube.com/shorts/nEMtTI-4SGk][demonstration]]) when doing Lead Rope Solo. The GriGri in HUR feeds better but will most likely not catch an inverted fall if held upright during the fall. The quick release is used to connect the grigri to the chest harness and should, during an inverted fall, release the grigri and let the grigri catch the fall.
